This morning, I finished reading *The Armor of Light* by Ken Follett, which is
the latest novel in the Kingsbridge series. I recommend the novel and I'd like
to share my enthusiasm. There won't be any spoilers in this post but there will
be hints, so if you haven't read the book and you plan to, you might as well
wait before reading the post.

I'm a fan of historical novels and this is not my first book by Follett.
(I've read *A Column of Fire*, *Fall of the Giants* and *Winter of the World*.)
His
books are extremely well-written and captivating: I find them to be wonderful
companions when I travel. I've also recommended them to a few friends, including
ones who are less in the habit of reading, and they've gone on to read
several books by Follett.

A quality I enjoy in Follett's books is that he lets us witness historical
events through the eyes of ordinary folks. Sometimes these characters end
up playing an instrumental role (in *Column of Fire*, one of the main
antagonists essentially causes the
[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre)).
Often times, the characters merely endure events that surpass them. They have
little agency in the unfolding of these events and yet they fully experience
their consequences. *The Armor of Light*, more so than other books I've read
by Follett, emphasizes this point.

The book mostly focuses on the town of Kingsbridge and how its habitants deal
with the impact of the Napoleonic wars (higher taxes, inflation, conscription,
and anti-union laws for fear of seeing the sparks of the French revolution
spread in Great Britain). The book doesn't go too deep into how the characters
feel about the french revolution--some express sympathy for the uprise against
aristocracy and the book often questions the competence of leaders who have
inherited their positions rather than earn them; others feel they have a
patriotic duty to defend their country against a potential French invasion.
But the characters mostly focus on how to improve their livelihood.
They fight either to give more rights to workers or deprive them of it;
they seek to educate or be educated; they struggle to feed their children;
or they compete to earn an army contract to supply uniforms for the army.

Another major theme in the book is the introduction of machinery in the
weaving industry. Naturally, the benefits of the technology are hardly
distributed: the business owners---who granted, invest and take the risk---reap
most of the benefits; the workers on the other hand are ruthlessly sacked,
lose their employment, and find themselves impoverished by the new
technology. The more reasonable employers, who care about the well-being of
their employees, are forced to follow suit in order to stay competitive
and keep their business afloat. The book introduces an unusual character (a working
class child in the first act of the book) who becomes an able engineer, earns his keep
selling machines and later finds himself at odds with his step father, who lost
his position at a mill.

A notable choice is that the book almost exclusively focuses on people
in Kingsbridge. This is to be contrasted with *A Column of Fire*, the previous
volume in the Kingsbridge series, whose characters are scattered across England,
France, Spain and more. I went into *Armor of Light* expecting the same.
When I saw the book started in 1792, I hoped to read about the rise of a working
class Frenchmen in the ranks of the revolutionary army---one whose perspective
would contrast with the British experience of the war; or perhaps a pupil of
Beethoven in Vienna, at first enthusiastic about the French republic and later
disappointed by the French empire. But Follett's decision to only gives us
Kingsbridge's perspective is effective: it portrays the war as a distant,
almost intangible thing that still completely disrupts the daily life of the
protagonists.

One reservation I had while reading the first half of the book is that the novel
clearly tells us which characters to root for and which ones to dislike.
There is nuance of course: some
characters have tragic backgrounds; others are flawed but the novel
signals that they are good-hearted and that we should not judge them too
harshly. But some characters seem simply there to be disliked. The first chapter
already depicts one such characters as absolutely despicable. He becomes
a formidable adversary to one of the protagonists. Emotionally, this is
effective: it makes us root for a character, it creates suspense and a
conflict whose resolution we care about. But it also makes the antagonist seem
flat. A mediocre and yet incredibly destructive being. An unrelatable person.
I prefer it when the characters can be understood and we can have some
sympathy for them---even if we ultimately disagree with their actions.
This bothered me a bit but it certainly did not stop me from reading.
Which is good because most of the characters *do* eventually change, undergo their arcs,
even though it takes many pages or many years in the story.
Sometimes, the arc carries out across generations,
with the children refusing to live as their parents did, which is always a
powerful theme. All in all, the novel reminded me that life is long, very long,
and that many things will change as the decades march by.

In conclusion, it was a very enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Even
though the novel is set in a historical period, much of its topics seem
particularly relevant to today's society. I like remembering that some of the
challenges we face are not as new as they might seem. And of
course, the book takes us into the innermost worlds of its characters: it
is fascinating to see their perspectives on historical events and
even more so to simply witness their humanity.
