Here are some papers, books, and other resources I have found helpful,
as a researcher and a student.
This is by no means an exhaustive bibliography, rather a list of personal favorites.
I'm very open to recommendations, if you have some suggestions.

### Conceptual papers

These are articles that discuss the roles of a model and various
approaches to analyzing data. While they are conceptual and even have a philosophical flavor,
they have very concrete implications. 

* **Mathematics for understanding disease** by Robert R. Bies, Marc R. Gastonguay, and Sorell. L. Schwartz.
[[link](https://indiana.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/mathematics-for-understanding-disease)]
 *Absract: The application of mathematical models to reflect the organization and activity of biological systems can be viewed as a continuum of purpose. The far left of the continuum is solely the prediction of biological parameter values, wherein an understanding of the underlying biological processes is irrelevant to the purpose. At the far right of the continuum are mathematical models, the purposes of which are a precise understanding of those biological processes...*
* **Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics** Andrew Gelman and Cosma Rohilla Shalizi.
[[link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/philosophy.pdf)]
*Abstract: A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism...*
* **Interview with Chris Wiggins** by Sebastian Gutierrez.
in Data Scientists at Work [[link](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430265986)]
*Note: Professor Chris Wiggins sent me this, following a phone conversation we had about graduate school and the field of systems biology. This was his reponse to some of my (naive) inquiries. The interview pins down many concepts in statistics, machine learning, and their applications. Highly enjoyable.*

### Tutorials and case studies

These are great places to get your hands dirty with modeling and coding.
Very close to home:

* **Torwards a principled Bayesian workflow** by Michael Betancourt. [[link](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html)]
*Excerpt: Given a probabilistic model and a particular observation, Bayesian inference is straightforward to implement. [...] Building a probabilistic model that is useful in a given application, however, is a far more open-ended challenge.* I moreover recommend [everything Michael writes](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/)
* **Advanced Use of Stan, RStan and Torsten for Pharmacometric Applications** by Bill Gillespie.
[[link](https://www.metrumrg.com/course/advanced-use-stan-rstan-torsten-pharmacometric-applications/)]
*The workshop provides a guided hands-on experience in the advanced use of Stan, rstan and Torsten for Bayesian PKPD modeling.* I also recommend most of the [courses offered by Metrum](https://www.metrumrg.com/courses/), for learning about pharmacometrics.
