Statistics is the backbone of <span style="color:Salmon">experimental and observational sciences</span>; it also give us many tools to understand <span style="color:Salmon">machine learning</span> and <span style="color:Salmon">artificial intelligence</span>.

I have now several times taught 1 -- 3 days workshops on modeling and data analysis.
My courses cover fundamental concepts in Bayesian modeling and some of the motivating theory, demonstrations on scientific examples, discussions of the "under-the-hood" algorithms that support statistical software, and hands-on coding exercises.
Here's a [testimony](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/19/i-just-wanted-to-say-that-for-the-first-time-in-three-4-years-of-efforts-i-have-a-way-to-estimate-my-model/) on a workshop I gave in 2020 at McGill University.
I quite enjoy teaching workshops on [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten). If you're interested in such a course, feel free to contact me!

As a graduate student, I also served as a teacher assistant for five consecutive years for the Department of Statistics at Columbia university, for courses at all levels (undergraduate, masters and PhD).
Upon graduation, I received the <span style="color:Salmon">Minghui Yu Teaching Assistant Award</span>, awarded by the director of graduate studies based on feedback from students.

# Textbooks

📚I'm a contributor to the upcoming textbook [Bayesian Workflow](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/workflow-book/), with some wonderful colleagues. This effort is lead by Andrew Gelman, Aki Vehtari, and Richard McElreath.

📚I'm a contributor to the upcoming second edition of the _Handbook of Markov chain Monte Carlo_, where I contributed the chapter [For how many iterations should we run Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02726).

# Outreach

Occasionally I write posts on the blog <span style="color:Salmon">Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</span>, primarily curated by Andrew Gelman. A list of my posts can be found [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/author/charles/).

Other outreach efforts:

🎙️(2024) I returned as a co-guest with fellow Stan developer Brian Ward on the podcast [_learning Bayesian Statistics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTECQ_uvOBc&ab_channel=LearningBayesianStatistics), hosted by Alex Andorra. This was the first live episode on the podcast with an audience and it took place at [StanCon 2024](https://mc-stan.org/learn-stan/stancon-talks.html#stancon-2024-oxford) at Oxford University.Our episode:<span style="color:Salmon">Exploring the Future of Stan</span>.

🎙️ (2024) I was a guest on the podcast [_learning Bayesian statistics_](https://learnbayesstats.com/episode/90-demystifying-mcmc-variational-inference-charles-margossian/), hosted by Alex Andorra. Our episode: <span style="color:Salmon">Demystifying MCMC and Variational Inference</span>.

📰 (2023) I was interviewed by science writer Mara Johnson-Groh for the Simons Foundation. The [article](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2023/06/12/between-knowing-nothing-and-knowing-for-sure-the-science-of-uncertainty/) <span style="color:Salmon">Between knowing nothing and knowing for sure: the science of uncertainty</span> provides an accessible overview of my research.
