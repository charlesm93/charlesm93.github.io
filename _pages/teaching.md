Statistics is the backbone of experimental and observational science, and as such it appears in most quantitative fields; it also give us many tools to understand machine learning. With some great colleagues, I try to distill important concepts, and develop pedagogically sound papers, software and courses for statistics, data science, and machine learning.

I have now several times taught 1 -- 3 days workshops on modeling and data analysis.
My courses cover fundamental concepts in Bayesian modeling and some of the motivating theory, demonstrations on scientific examples, discussions of the "under-the-hood" algorithms that support statistical software, and hands-on coding exercises.
Here's a [testimony](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/19/i-just-wanted-to-say-that-for-the-first-time-in-three-4-years-of-efforts-i-have-a-way-to-estimate-my-model/) on a workshop I gave in 2020 at McGill University in Montreal.
I quite enjoy teaching workshops on [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten). If you're interested in such a course, feel free to contact me!

As a graduate student, I also served as a teacher assistant for five consecutive years for the department of statistics at Columbia university, for courses at all levels (undergraduate, masters and PhD).
Upon graduation, I recieved the <span style="color:maroon">Minghui Yu Teaching Assistant Award</span>, awarded by the director of graduate studies based on feedback from students.

# Outreach

Occasionally I write posts on the blog <span style="color:maroon">Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</span>, primarily curated by Andrew Gelman. A list of my posts can be found [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/author/charles/).

Other outreach efforts:

* (2024) I was the invited guess for the podcast [_learning Bayesian statistics_](https://learnbayesstats.com/episode/90-demystifying-mcmc-variational-inference-charles-margossian/), hosted by Alex Andorra. Our episode: <span style="color:maroon">Demystifying MCMC and Variational Inference</span>.
* (2023) I was interviewed by science writer Mara Johnson-Groh for the Simons Foundation. The [article](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2023/06/12/between-knowing-nothing-and-knowing-for-sure-the-science-of-uncertainty/) <span style="color:maroon">Between knowing nothing and knowing for sure: the science of uncertainty</span> provides an accessible overview of my research.
* (2021) I was a guest for the series [_Bayes. Uncertainty. Explained_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNvClBFhcY), hosted by Generable. Our episode: <span style="color:maroon">Some Outstanding Challenges when Solving ODEs in a Bayesian context</span>.
