In some sense, statistics is the backbone of experimental and observational science.
But statistics is (really f***ing) hard, and requires a level of mathematics which is not always
available to practitioners.
Distilling and communicating important concepts is a bit of an art. 
Some of my colleagues are very dedicated pedagogues and I try (with various degrees of success)
to follow their example.

My teaching experience falls into two categories:
I TA courses taught by Columbia's department of statistics,
and teach or TA workshops targeted at specialists, who may not be statisticians.

### Guest lecturer

I've been invited as a guest speaker for the following courses and conference:

* (2018) _Probability and Bayes_, PHC 506: Biometry in Pharmaceutics, University of Buffalo, School of Pharmacy, Buffalo, NY.
* (2018) _How to Develop for the Stan C++ Core Language_, Stan Conference 2018, Pacific Grove, CA. [[slides](https://github.com/charlesm93/presentations-and-writing/blob/master/StanCon2018_tutorial/Roadmap.pdf)]
* (2017) _Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis with Stan_, STAT 220: Bayesian Statistics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA
