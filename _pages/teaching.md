In some sense, statistics is the backbone of experimental and observational science, and as such it appears in most scientific and quantitative fields.
But statistics is (really f***ing) hard.
With colleagues, I work hard to distill and communicate important concepts, and develop pedagogically sound papers, notebooks, software and courses.

My work as a teacher falls into two categories:
I've been a teacher assistant for five consecutive years for courses taught by Columbia's department of statistics, at all levels (undergraduate, masters and PhD).
I also teach and TA intensive one or two days workshops targeted at audiences from various backgrounds, including biomedicine, physics, and political science.

I have limited availability to teach the workshops listed below; if you're interested, feel free to contact me!

### Instructor
