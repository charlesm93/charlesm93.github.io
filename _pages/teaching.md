In some sense, statistics is the backbone of experimental and observational science.
But statistics is (really f***ing) hard.
With colleagues, I work hard to distill and communicate important concepts,
and develop principled statistical workflows.

My work as a teacher falls into two categories:
I TA courses taught by Columbia's department of statistics,
and teach or TA workshops targeted at specialists, who may not be statisticians.

### Instructor

I've been invited as a guest speaker for the following courses and conferences:

* (2019) _Population and ODE-based models using Stan and Torsten_,
co-instructor with [Yi Zhang](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/yi-zhang-ph-d/), Stan Conference 2019, Cambridge, UK
* (2019) _Probability and Bayes II_, PHC 506: Biometry in Pharmaceutics, University of Buffalo, School of Pharmacy, Buffalo, NY. [[notes](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/Prob&BayesII.pdf)]
* (2019) _Building, fitting, and criticizing Bayesian PK/PD models using Stan and Torsten_ , University of Buffalo, School of Pharmacy, Buffalo, NY. (1 day workshop)
* (2019) _Stan for the people: introductory workshop on Bayesian modeling_, McGill University,
Montreal, Canada. (two days workshop)
* (2018) _Probability and Bayes_, PHC 506: Biometry in Pharmaceutics, University of Buffalo, School of Pharmacy, Buffalo, NY. [[notes](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/Prob&Bayes.pdf)]
* (2018) _How to Develop for the Stan C++ Core Language_, Stan Conference 2018, Pacific Grove, CA. [[slides](https://github.com/charlesm93/presentations-and-writing/blob/master/StanCon2018_tutorial/Roadmap.pdf)]
* (2017) _Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis with Stan_, STAT 220: Bayesian Statistics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA
