Statistics is the backbone of experimental and observational science, and as such it appears in most quantitative fields; it also give us many tools to understand machine learning.
With colleagues, I try to distill important concepts, and develop pedagogically sound papers, software and courses.
Currently I'm writing chapters for the upcoming textbook _Bayesian Workflow_; an early outline of this work exists as a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808).

I have now several times taught 1 -- 2 days workshops on modeling and data analysis.
My courses cover fundamental concepts in Bayesian statistics and some of the motivating theory, demonstrations on scientific examples, discussions of the "under-the-hood" algorithms that support statistical software, and hands-on coding exercises.
Here's a [testimony](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/19/i-just-wanted-to-say-that-for-the-first-time-in-three-4-years-of-efforts-i-have-a-way-to-estimate-my-model/) on a workshop I gave in 2020 at McGill University in Montreal.
I quite enjoy teaching workshops on [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten). If you're interested in such a course, feel free to contact me!

As a graduate student, I also served as a teacher assistant for five consecutive years for the department of statistics at Columbia university, for courses at all levels (undergraduate, masters and PhD).
Upon graduation, I recieved the _Minghui Yu Teaching Assistant Award_, awarded by the director of graduate studies based on feedback from students.

### Outreach

Occasionally I write posts on the blog _Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science_, primarily curated by Andrew Gelman, in an effort to summarize ongoing research:

* (2023) [Parallelization for Markov chain Monte Carlo with heterogeneous runtimes: a case-study on ODE-based models](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/03/20/parallelization-for-markov-chain-monte-carlo-with-heterogeneous-runtimes-a-case-study-on-ode-based-models/)
* (2022) [What Nested R-hat teaches us about the classical R-hat](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/10/05/what-nested-r-hat-teaches-us-about-the-classical-r-hat/)
* (2021) [Design choices and user experience in Stan and TensorFlow Probability](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/11/20/design-choices-and-user-experience-in-stan-and-tensorflow-probability/)
