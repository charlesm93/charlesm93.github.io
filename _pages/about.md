 This August (2022), I will start as a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Center for Computational Mathematics.
 I just completed my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University, with Andrew Gelman as my advisor.
 I'm interested in the development and application of novel statistical methods to the life and physical sciences. Much of my work focuses on Bayesian modeling and its computational implementation.

I'm a developer of the probabilistic programing language [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of  [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm.pdf).
