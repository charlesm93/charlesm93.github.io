I'm a Postdoc Research Fellow in Computational Mathematics at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), a part of the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/). In 2022, I earned a PhD in Statistics from Columbia University. You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesmcv.pdf)

# Research Interests

My research broadly concerns Bayesian modeling and probabilistic machine learning. This work bridges theory, computation, and application through the development of probabilistic programming languages such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability). Some keywords:

* **Computation:** Markov chain Monte Carlo, Variational inference, integrated Laplace approximation, automatic differentiation
* **Modeling:** Bayesian workflow, Hierarchical models, ODE-based models
* **Applications:** Pharmacometrics, Epidemiology, Astrophysics

# News

* Starting in the summer of 2025, I will be an assistant professor of Statistics at the <span style="color:Salmon">University of British Columbia</span>. You can read a [short statement](https://charlesm93.github.io/files/letter_move_to_UBC.pdf) about my move.

* May 3-5 2025: Lawrence Saul and I received the <span style="color:Salmon">best paper award</span> at [AISTATS 2025](https://virtual.aistats.org/) for our paper on [Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11067).

* June 3-5 2025: I will attend the [ASA/IMS Spring Research Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/src-2025) in New York. There I will speak at the session on <span style="color:Salmon">Approximate Bayesian Methods</span>.

* June 16-20 2025: I will attend [BayesComp](https://bayescomp2025.sg/) in Singapore to chair a session on <span style="color:Salmon">Parallel Computation for Markov chain Monte Carlo</span>, and give an invited talk at the session on <span style="color:Salmon">Advances in Variational Inference</span>.
