I am a Research Fellow in Computational Mathematics at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), a part of the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/). In 2022, I earned a PhD in Statistics from Columbia University. You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesmcv.pdf).

My research concerns statistics and probabilistic machine learning. My work bridges methodology, computation, and application through the development of probabilistic programming languages such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability). Some keywords:

* **Computation:** Markov chain Monte Carlo, Variational inference, integrated Laplace approximation, automatic differentiation
* **Modeling:** Bayesian workflow, Hierarchical models, ODE-based models
* **Applications:** Pharmacometrics, Epidemiology, Astrophysics

# News

* Starting in the summer of 2025, I will be an assistant professor of statistics at the <span style="color:Salmon">University of British Columbia</span>.

* May 2025: I will attend AISTATS in Thailand to present our recent paper on [Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11067). (Depending on circumstances, I may attend virtually.)

* June 2025: I will attend BayesComp in Singapore to chair a session on <span style="color:Salmon">Parallel Computation for Markov chain Monte Carlo</span>, and give an invited talk at the session on <span style="color:Salmon">Advances in Variational Inference</span>.
