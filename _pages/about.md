I'm a Research Fellow in Computational Mathematics at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), a part of the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).
My primary interest lies in the development of statistical and machine learning methods with applications in the natural sciences.
Much of my research is motivated by Bayesian modeling problems in pharmacometrics and epidemiology.
I study Markov chain Monte Carlo and approximate Bayesian inference, as well as hybrids which combine the two paradigms.

My work bridges statistical methods, computation, and application through the development of probabilistic programing languages.
I'm a core developer of the Bayesian inference software [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), the co-creator of its pharmacometrics extension [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), and I have an ongoing collaboration with the [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) team.

I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2022 and a B.Sci. in Physics from Yale University in 2015.

### News

* In September, I'll be teaching a three-day workshop on Stan at the [Summer on Advanced Bayesian Methods](https://ibiostat.be/seminar/summerschool2023) in Leuven, Beligum. 
* In August, I'll be attending the [Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.auai.org/uai2023/) (UAI) conference in Pittsburgh to present [recent work on variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09163).
* My [interview](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2023/06/12/between-knowing-nothing-and-knowing-for-sure-the-science-of-uncertainty/) for the Simons Foundation with science writer Mara Johnson-Groh is out. It provides an accessible overview of my research.
