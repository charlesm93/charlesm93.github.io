I just completed my PhD in statistics at Columbia Univeristy. This August, I will start as a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute, Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). I'm interested in the development and application of novel statistical methods to the life and physical sciences. Much of my work focuses on Bayesian modeling and its computational implementation.

I'm a developer of the probabilistic programing language [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of  [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm.pdf).
