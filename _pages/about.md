I'm an (incoming) assistant professor of statistics at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver.
Currently, I'm finishing a postdoc fellowship in computational mathematics at
the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/),
a part of the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/)
in New York. I earned a PhD in statistics from Columbia University.

You can find out more by looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesmcv.pdf)
and browsing this website.


## Research Interests

My research broadly concerns Bayesian modeling and probabilistic machine learning.
This work bridges theory, computation, and application through the development
of probabilistic programming languages such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and
[TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability).


## News

* June 29 - July 06 2025: I will teach at the [summer school on cryptography,
statistics and machine learning](https://mathschool.ysu.am/) in Tsaghkadzor, Armenia.
My course: <span style="color:Salmon">Bayesian Statistics: a practical introduction.</span>

* June 16-20 2025: I will attend [BayesComp](https://bayescomp2025.sg/) in
Singapore to chair a session on <span style="color:Salmon">Parallel Computation
for Markov chain Monte Carlo</span>, and give an invited talk at the session
on <span style="color:Salmon">Advances in Variational Inference</span>.

* May 3-5 2025: Lawrence Saul and I received the
<span style="color:Salmon">best paper award</span> at
[AISTATS 2025](https://virtual.aistats.org/) for our paper
on [Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11067).

* I accepted a position as an assistant professor of statistics at UBC: here's
a [short statement](https://charlesm93.github.io/files/letter_move_to_UBC.pdf).
