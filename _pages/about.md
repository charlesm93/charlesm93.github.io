My focus is on the development and application of novel statistical methods
to the life and physical sciences.
The search for robust techniques to build, fit, and criticize quantiative models
has lead me to Bayesian statistics and its computational implementations.
I find that many modern problems require an interdisciplinary approach,
which is why I enjoy collaborating with experts from various disciplines.
I moreover believe a scientist's loyality should be to a problem, not a field.

This website contains an overview of my research, as well as additional resources
you might find helpful. Do not hesitate to reach out: I'm always happy to talk
science, be it about a specific problem, more general ideas, or teaching.
