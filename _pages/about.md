I'm a Research Fellow in Computational Mathematics at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), a part of the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).
My primary interest lies in the development of statistical and machine learning methods with applications in the natural sciences.
Much of my research is motivated by Bayesian modeling problems in pharmacometrics and epidemiology.
I study Markov chain Monte Carlo and approximate Bayesian inference, as well as hybrids which combine the two paradigms.

My work bridges statistical methods, computation, and application through the development of probabilistic programing languages.
I'm a core developer of the Bayesian inference software [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), the co-creator of its pharmacometrics extension [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), and I have an ongoing collaboration with the [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) team.

I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2022 and a B.Sci. in Physics from Yale University in 2015.

### News

* I'll be attending the [BayesComp 2023 conference](https://bayescomp2023.com/) in Finland this March.
* Call for talks, sessions, tutorials and posters at the upcoming [StanCon 2023](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2023/) are now open! The conference will take place in June in St Louis Missouri.
