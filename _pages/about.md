This website contains an overview of my research, as well as additional resources
you might find helpful.

In a nutshell, my work focuses on the development and application of
novel statistical methods to the life and physical sciences.
The search for robust techniques to build, fit and criticize models has
led me to Bayesian inference and its computational implementations.

I'm a developer of the probabilistic programing language
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of 
[Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension
of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my
[CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm.pdf).
