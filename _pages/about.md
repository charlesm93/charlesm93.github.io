I'm a (soon to be*) Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Center for Computational Mathematics.
 I completed my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University, with Andrew Gelman as my advisor.
 I'm interested in the development and application of novel statistical methods to the life and physical sciences. Much of my work focuses on Bayesian modeling and its computational implementation.

I'm a developer of the probabilistic programing language [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of  [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm.pdf).

*: I start my postdoc in August 2022.
