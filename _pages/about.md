I'm a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Center for Computational Mathematics.
I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2022 and a B.Sci. in Physics from Yale University in 2015.
My primary interest lies in the development of Statistical and Machine Learning methods with applications in the natural sciences.
Much of my research is motivated by Bayesian modeling problems in Pharmacometrics and Epidemiology.
I study Markov chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) and approximate Bayesian computation, as well as hybrids which combine the two paradigms.
My work bridges statistical methods, computation, and application through the development of probabilistic programing.
I'm a core developer of the Bayesian inference software [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), the co-creator of its Pharmacometrics extension [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), and I have ongoing collaboration with the [TensorFlow Probability team](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability).
