I'm an assistant professor of statistics at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver, Canada.
My research primarily concerns algorithms for Bayesian modeling and probabilistic machine
learning. I'm interested in the application of these methods in several areas,
including public health, biomedicine and astrophysics. An outcome of this
research is the development of high-performance open-source software, such as
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), which empower scientists to analyze complex data.

I also teach at all levels (undergraduate, masters and PhD), and I'm passionate
about how a statistics curriculum can help students build a foundation
in all empirical sciences, understand modern topics such as AI,
and develop critical thinking.
