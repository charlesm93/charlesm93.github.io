I'm a fourth year PhD student in statistics at Columbia Univeristy, advised by Andrew Gelman. I'm interested in the development and application of novel statistical methods to the life and physical sciences. Much of my work focuses on Bayesian modeling and its computational implementation.

I'm a developer of the probabilistic programing language [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of  [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my [CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm.pdf).
