I'm an assistant professor of Statistics at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/).
My research primarily focuses on the development and understanding of
algorithms that underlie probabilistic programming languages, especially when
used for Bayesian modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning.
I'm interested in the application of these methods in several areas,
including Public Health, Biomedical Engineering, Ecology and Astrophysics.
An outcome of this research is the development of high-performance open-source
software, such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), which empower scientists to
analyze complex data.

You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my
[CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesmcv.pdf).
