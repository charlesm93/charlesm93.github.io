This website contains an overview of my research, as well as additional resources
you might find helpful. Do not hesitate to reach out: I'm always happy to talk
science, be it about a specific problem, more general concepts, or teaching.

Here's my work in a nutshell. 
I focus on the development and application of novel statistical methods
to the life and physical sciences.
The search for robust techniques to build, fit, and criticize models
has led me to Bayesian statistics and its computational implementations.

I'm best known as a developer of the probabilistic programing language
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and the co-creator of 
[Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten), an extension
of Stan for biomedical applications.
You can find out more by browsing this website or looking at my
[CV](http://charlesm93.github.io/files/charlesm-2018.pdf).
