Since August 2025, I'm an assistant professor of statistics at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver.

I was born and raised in Paris, France. My high-school degree was in Science,
with a specialty in Mathematics.

I then moved to the U.S and studied Physics at Yale University.
I did research in Astronomy with the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/), under the supervision of
professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php)
and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/).

After graduating, I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/), a
biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation. There, I completed
a one-year Pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford, CT, and continued as a visiting
scientist for another year, in Boston, MA. I worked closely with
[Bill Gillespie](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/william-r-gillespie-ph-d/)
on the mathematical modeling of biomedical processes, with an emphasis on
Bayesian inference and its computational implementations.


From 2017 to 2022, I pursued a PhD in Statistics at Columbia University and
wrote a [PhD thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/0wsc-kz90)
on Markov chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian modeling.
My advisor was professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

From 2022 to 2025, I was a postdocotoral research fellow at the
[Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/),
Center for Computational Mathematics, in New York. My primary affiliation was
with the  Computational Statistics group. I was also part of the institute's
greater research effort in
[Machine Learning](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/machine-learning-at-the-flatiron-institute/).

## Hobbies
I do competitive ballroom dancing with some wonderful
people at Columbia University and in New York. I'm always down for a game of
pick-up soccer and occasionally I play in a league.

As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/),
a comedy group that does short form and musical improvisation.
In Hartford, I co-founded the Albatross, which still plays at the
[Sea Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately, but I attend the occasional jam
(and I still "follow the fear.")
