Currently, I'm a PhD student in statistics at Columbia University,
advised by professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

I was borned and raised in Paris, France. 
My high-school degree was in science, with a specialty in mathematics.

I then moved to the U.S and studied physics at Yale University.
I did research in astronomy with the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/), under the supervision
of professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php)
and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/).

After graduating, I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/),
a biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation.
There, I completed a one-year pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford, CT,
and continued as a visiting scientist for another year, in Boston, MA.
I worked closely with [Bill Gillespie](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/william-r-gillespie-ph-d/)
on the mathematical modeling of biomedical processes,
with an emphasis on Bayesian statistics and its computational implementations.

In September 2017, I joined the PhD program in statistics at Columbia University.

### Hobbies
As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/),
a comedy group that does short form and musical improvisation.
In Hartford, I co-founded the Albatross, which still plays at the [Sea Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately, but I attend the occasional jam.

Other than that, I sometimes draw cartoons and I'm always down for a pick-up soccer game. 
I've started doing ballroom dancing with some wonderful people at Columbia.
