Currently, I'm a PhD student in statistics at Columbia University,
advised by professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

I was born and raised in Paris, France.

After completing my high-school diploma, I moved the U.S and studied
Physics at Yale University.
There I did research with the Astronomy department and the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/).
With professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php)
and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/) as my advisors,
I wrote my undergraduate thesis on
_Testing the effects of close-in giant planets on stellar magnetic activity_.
I also did related work on measuring stellar rotation periods and estimating
the age of stars.
These research projects were all coding and data intensive,
and exposed me to many statistical problems.
Of particular concern to me was properly characterizing uncertainy and decoupling
signal and noise.

By the time I was a senior, I wanted to learn more about statistics and
work on more applied problems. 
After graduating in May 2015, I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/),
a biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation.
There, I completed a one-year pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford, CT,
and continued as a visiting scientist for another year, in Boston, MA.
I worked closely with [Bill Gillespie](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/william-r-gillespie-ph-d/)
on the development of computational tools to do Bayesian modeling for biomedical applications.
We started a collaboration with the Stan development team, and Andrew Gelman's group
at Columbia.
This is when I became a Stan developer, and also when Bill and I invented Torsten.

I then faced the difficult choice of returning to Physics for graduate school,
diving deeper into Statistics, or even joining a Quantitative Biomedicine program.
When making a decision, I was helped by a, perhaps misinterpreted, citation of Jean-Paul Sartres:
"You're free to choose, that is invent." Eventually, I joined the PhD program in Statistics
at Columbia (aftet flipping a coin multiple times), 
eager to "invent" my own path and expose myself to all the disciplines
that could help me solve the problems I was interested in.
I like to think my loyality is to a problem, not a field, though realistically,
this is only true to some degree.

My time in New York so far has been mostly spent on coursework and formalizing my understanding
of mathematical statistics. I still do research and I also work as a teacher assistant.
And I spend a lot of time wondering what I'm going to write my dissertation on.

### Hobbies
As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/),
a comedy group that does both short form and musical improv.
In Hartford, I co-founded the Albatross, which still plays at the [Seat Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately, but I attend the occasional jam.
I would love to work with a musical group, provided we can find a pianist who's up to the task.

Other than that, I sometimes draw cartoons and I'm always down for a pick-up soccer game. 
I've started doing ballroom dancing, which
is to my previous dancing what real analysis was to my calculus (help!).
