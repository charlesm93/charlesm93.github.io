Currently, I'm a PhD student in statistics at Columbia University,
advised by professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

I was borned and raised in Paris, France. 
My high-school degree was in science, with a specialty in mathematics.

After graduating, I moved to the U.S and studied Physics at Yale University.
I did research in the Astronomy department with the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/), under the supervision
of professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php)
and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/).
My undergraduate thesis was on close-in giant planets and their effect on the
magnetic activity of their host star.
I also did related work on estimating the rotation period and age
of stars in the Kepler field.

By the time I was a senior, I wanted to learn more about statistics
and work in a more applied field.
I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/),
a biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation.
There, I completed a one-year pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford, CT,
and continued as a visiting scientist for another year, in Boston, MA.
I worked closely with [Bill Gillespie](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/william-r-gillespie-ph-d/)
on the mathematical modeling of biomedical processes,
with an emphasis on Bayesian statistics and its computational implementations.

I then faced the difficult choice of returning to Physics for graduate school,
diving deeper into Statistics, or even joining a Quantitative Biomedicine program.
When making a decision, I was helped by a perhaps misinterpreted quote by
Jean-Paul Sartre: "You're free: choose, that is invent."
Eventually, I jointed the PhD program in Statistics at Columbia,
eager to "invent" my own path and study all the disciplines
that could help me solve the problems I am interested in.
I like to think a scientist's loyalty should be to a problem, not a field.

My time in New York so far has been mostly spent on coursework and formalizing my understanding
of mathematical statistics. I still do research and work as a teacher assistant.

### Hobbies
As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/),
a comedy group that does both short form and musical improv.
In Hartford, I co-founded the Albatross, which still plays at the [Seat Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately, but I attend the occasional jam.

Other than that, I sometimes draw cartoons and I'm always down for a pick-up soccer game. 
I've started doing ballroom dancing with some wonderful people at Columbia.
