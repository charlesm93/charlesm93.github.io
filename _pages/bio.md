August 2022, I'm starting a new job as a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Center for Computational Mathematics.

I was borned and raised in Paris, France. 
My high-school degree was in Science, with a specialty in Mathematics.

I then moved to the U.S and studied Physics at Yale University.
I did research in Astronomy with the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/), under the supervision of professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php) and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/).

After graduating, I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/), a biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation.
There, I completed a one-year Pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford, CT, and continued as a visiting scientist for another year, in Boston, MA.
I worked closely with [Bill Gillespie](https://metrumrg.com/team_member/william-r-gillespie-ph-d/) on the mathematical modeling of biomedical processes, with an emphasis on Bayesian inference and its computational implementations.


In August 2017, I started a PhD in Statistics at Columbia University. 
April 2022, I defended my [PhD thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/0wsc-kz90).
My advisor was professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

### Hobbies
As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/), a comedy group that does short form and musical improvisation.
In Hartford, I co-founded the Albatross, which still plays at the [Sea Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately, but I attend the occasional jam.

Other than that, I sometimes draw cartoons and I'm always down for a pick-up soccer game. 
I've started doing ballroom dancing with some wonderful people at Columbia.
