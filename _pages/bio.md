I'm Ph.D student in statistics at Columbia University,
advised by professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).
Prior to that, I worked at [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/),
a biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation.
I obtained a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale University,
where I did research with the [exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/).

Broadly speaking, my goal is to develop the theory and computational tools
that enable scientists to express their models in the language of probability,
and perform robust inference on these models.
Much of my efforts has been through the development of new features for
[Stan](mc-stan.org), a probabilistic programing language, primarly designed to do
Bayesian analysis.
I am also the co-creator of [Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten),
an extension of Stan for pharmacometrics models.
