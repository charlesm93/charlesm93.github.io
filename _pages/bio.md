Since August 2025, I'm an assistant professor of statistics at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver.

I was born and raised in Paris, France. My high-school degree was in Science,
with a specialty in Mathematics. I was also interested in the humanities
and _almost_ pursued a degree in Literature instead of Science. Despite my
commitment to the natural sciences, I was fortunate to be one of the students
that represented my school for the _concours général de littérature_ and
the _concours d'anglais_ (but I didn't win either contest 😶).

I then moved to the U.S and studied Physics at Yale University within the
context of a liberal arts education. I did research in Astronomy with the
[exoplanet group](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/), under the supervision of
professor [Debra Fischer](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/people/dfischer.php)
and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/wang.12220/).

After graduating, I joined [Metrum Research Group](https://metrumrg.com/), a
biomedical lab that specializes in modeling and simulation. There, I completed
a one-year Pharmacometrics bootcamp in Hartford and continued as a visiting
scientist for another year, in Boston. I worked closely with
Bill Gillespie
on the mathematical modeling of biomedical processes, with an emphasis on
Bayesian inference and its computational implementations.


From 2017 to 2022, I pursued a PhD in Statistics at Columbia University and
wrote a [PhD thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/0wsc-kz90)
on Markov chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian modeling under the supervision of
professor [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/).

From 2022 to 2025, I was a postdocotoral research fellow at the
[Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/),
Center for Computational Mathematics, in New York. My primary affiliation was
with the  Computational Statistics group. I was also part of the institute's
greater research effort in
[Machine Learning](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/machine-learning-at-the-flatiron-institute/).

## Hobbies
I do competitive ballroom dancing with some awesome people in Vancouver
and before that I did it in New York (with some just as awesome people).
I'm always down for a game of pick-up football/soccer and I occasionally play in a league.

As an undergraduate, I was a member of [Just Add Water](http://www.justaddwateryale.com/),
a comedy group that does short form and musical improvisation.
In Hartford, I was involved with the [Sea Tea](https://seateaimprov.com/) theater
and the wonderful community around it.
I have not been improvising on a regular basis lately but I still "follow the fear."
